# Direct DB introspection under stable: the API returns previews of
# payload columns and hides the migrations journal. Open the sqlite
# file directly to capture invariants the API can't:
#  - `__drizzle_migrations` row count: proves how many migrations have
#    been applied, so we can detect a journal that gets *wiped* during
#    upgrade (catastrophic — drizzle would re-run all migrations against
#    an already-migrated schema and corrupt data).
#  - Raw `input_payload` for fixture 1's root span: API truncates this
#    to preview_chars. A migration that silently shortens the column
#    type or rewrites it would pass the outline check but break the
#    actual payload pane. Snapshot the prompt text from the raw column.
#  - Schema table set: catches a migration that drops a table entirely.
# sqlite3 CLI is preinstalled on ubuntu-latest GHA runners.
